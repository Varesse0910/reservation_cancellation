# Deep Learning for Business Project: Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations  

#### Project Description  Booking cancellations in hospitality industry have risen due to Online Travel Agencies (OTA) making it as the main selling point in their marketing campaign. The increase makes it harder for hotels to accurately forecast, leading to non-optimized occupancy and revenue lost. This causes direct financial consequences as well as operational problems.  In order to solve this problem, we will use a real-life hotel booking dataset to create a customer segmentation analysis in order to gain insights about the customers (and hopefully reasons why they cancel their reservation). We will then build a classification model (including the newly created customer clusters) to predict whether or not a booking will be canceled with the highest accuracy possible.   #### Dataset Description  Our goal is to build a model able to classify a booking as canceled or not canceled. The dataset provides data from real bookings scheduled to arrive between July, 1st 2015 and August, 31st 2017 from two hotels in Portugal (a resort in the Algarve region (H1) and a hotel in the city of Lisbon (H2)). Booking data from both hotels share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. For a detailed list and description of those variables refer to the data dictionary.
